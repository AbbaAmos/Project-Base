# Project-Base
The aim of this scrape homework project is to show the countries of origin and ratings of the different directors of movies rated in the BBC 21st Century's 100 greatest films on this website http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/BBC.html to preserve its original form.

This first scrape targets the names of the 177 critics who voted in the list, the critics' organsation, critics' country, movie names, directors and year of movie release, using BeautifulSoup and Regex to identify specific patterns.
